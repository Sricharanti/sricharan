INTRODUCTION:

IrKBD is the keyboard/mouse protocol use by the Tekram IR-660 docking
station. Without this docking-station there is no use in this program.

Keyboard input with IrKBD will only work when running X11 since the program
feeds raw scancodes back into the kernel again. 

HOWTO USE:

One way of using irkbd is to let gpm read the input from /dev/irkbd. The
next line is taken from my /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm startup script.

gpm -R -t $MOUSETYPE -M -t ps2 -m /dev/irkbd

As you can see, gpm will read both the internal and "external" mice. Gpm
will feed its output to /dev/gpmdata which can be read by X. Remember that gpm will output its data in MouseSystems format:

Section "Pointer"
   Protocol        "MouseSystems"
   Device          "/dev/gpmdata"
   BaudRate        1200
   Emulate3Timeout 50
EndSection

So now you should be able to use both your internal mouse and the external
connected to the IrDA docking station.
