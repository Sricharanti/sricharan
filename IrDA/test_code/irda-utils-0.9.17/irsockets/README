	Sample directory
	----------------

	This directory contains a few sample program illustrating how
to use the socket interface of the IrDA stack (IrSock) and how to
write your own applications on top of IrSock.
	Note that applications can also use the OpenObex library on
top of IrSock (prefered), or run on top of IrComm (discouraged). And
there is also the option of using TCP/IP over IrDA.
	If you want more example of use of IrDA, you are encouraged to
look at the source code of OpenObex and e-Squirt.

irprintf
--------
	Sample IrSock server. Wait for connections from irscanf and
dump on the console everything received over the IrDA socket.

irscanf
-------
	Sample IrSock client. Grab anything from the console and sends
it to the irprintf application. The combination of irscanf and
irprintf make a crude one way chat over IrDA.

irprintfx/irscanfx
------------------
	Same programs as irprintf/irscanf, use internally file
descriptors instead of stream (and therefore simpler).

irdaspray
---------
	Utility to test IrDA performance. Can generate unidirectional
or bidirectional streams of packets between a Client and a Server.
	For example :
		Client : irdaspray -n 10 -b 2000
		Server : irdaspray -s
	More command line options and features are available, check
the source code for details.
	The code also contains many examples on how to use some of the
most advanced features of the Linux-IrDA stack, so is a good place to
start if you want to program something fancy.

send_ultra
----------
	Send an Ultra packet (connectionless broadcast)

recv_ultra
----------
	Wait and receive some Ultra packets

ias_query
---------
	Perform an IAS query to a remote device. This version works.
	Note that the irdaspray code contains many more example of
interaction with IAS.

oldies
------
	Older applications. Those have some known problems, and some
portions of the code is bad practice.
