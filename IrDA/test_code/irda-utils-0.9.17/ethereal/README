		Ethereal capture
		----------------

	You can now use Ethereal to display your IrDA traces, so you
can do traffic analysis from a GUI. This is still experimental and is
a work in progress.
	There is basically two possibilities :
	1) Read from capture files
	2) Read from live IrDA interface

1) Packages
-----------
	You will need those packages
	1) ethereal-0.10.1 or later
	2) irda-utils 0.9.17-pre2 or later
	3) libpcap-0.8.2 or later
	Note : until those packages are released, just grab the latest
CVS version...

2) Capture file method
----------------------
	1) Start generate a capture file using "irdadump -w file.dump"
	2) Stop capture with CTRL-C
	3) Start Ethereal
	4) Open the capture file (File->Open)

3) Live IrDA interface method
-----------------------------
	1) Start Ethereal
	2) Open capture window (Capture->Start)
	3) Select IrDA interface (for example 'irda0')
	4) Check "Update list of packets in real time" box
	5) Start capture on IrDA interface

4) Ethereal IrDA parsing
------------------------
	The current IrDA parsing done by Ethereal is quite different
from what is available in irdadump because not based on the same
codebase.
	Decoding output looks very different and fields don't have the
same name. Some higher layer protocols are not parsed by Ethereal, for
example Obex and IrNET. On the other hand, Ethereal gives more details
in some of the fields.

5) Extra
--------
	Thanks to Shaun Jackman and Jan Kiszka for the initial work, I
did heavily modified their code to make it "clean". Thanks to Guy
Harris for integrating our code in libpcap and Ethereal.
	I won't be maintaining the Ethereal code, so all questions and
patches should be addressed to Jan Kiszka.

	Have fun...
