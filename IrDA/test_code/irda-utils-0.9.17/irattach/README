irattach is used to bind the Linux-IrDA stack to a device driver. So this
is something you must do in order to use IrDA on your Linux machine.
irattach must be run as root or installed setuid root, as it requires root
privileges

Usage: irattach <dev> [-d dongle] [-s]

where
       <dev>        usually the name of a tty, but can also be a FIR device
       -d dongle    attaches a dongle driver (see below for more info)
       -s           starts discovery of remote IrDA devices

Dongles:

The currently known dongles are:

tekram      Tekram IrMate IR-210B dongle
esi         Extended Systems JetEye PC (ESI-9680) dongle
actisys     ACTiSYS IR-220L dongle
actisys+    ACTiSYS IR-220L+ dongle
girbil      Greenwich GIrBIL dongle
litelink    Parallax LiteLink dongle
airport
old_belkin  Belkin (old) SmartBeam dongle

Modules:

If you have compiled the IrDA stack as modules (recommended), then you will
need to add these entries to your /etc/modules.conf file

# IrDA over a normal serial port, or a serial port compatible IrDA port
alias tty-ldisc-11 irtty

# IrCOMM (for printing, PPP, Minicom etc)
alias char-major-161 ircomm-tty

# To be able to attach some dongles
alias irda-dongle-0 tekram
alias irda-dongle-1 esi
alias irda-dongle-2 actisys
alias irda-dongle-3 actisys
alias irda-dongle-4 girbil
alias irda-dongle-5 litelink
alias irda-dongle-6 airport
alias irda-dongle-7 old_belkin

# To use the NSC driver on a Thinkpad laptop
options nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x09
alias irda0 nsc-ircc

Examples

Attach the IrDA stack to the second serial port and start discovery

$ ./irattach /dev/ttyS1 -s

Attach the IrDA stack to the first serial port where you have an ACTiSYS
dongle and start discovery

$ ./irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys -s

Attach the IrDA stack to the NSC FIR (4Mbps) device driver on a Thinkpad
laptop. You must also add some entries to /etc/conf.modules (see above)

$ ./irattach irda0 -s 1

Device entries you will need to use IrCOMM:

mknod /dev/ircomm0 c 161 0
mknod /dev/ircomm1 c 161 1
mknod /dev/irlpt0 c 161 17
mknod /dev/irlpt1 c 161 17

Afterwards, then "ll /dev/ir*" should look like this:

crw-r--r--    1 root     161,   0 Dec 22 14:15 /dev/ircomm0
crw-r--r--    1 root     161,   1 Nov  5 08:36 /dev/ircomm1
crw-r--r--    1 root     161,  16 Nov  5 08:36 /dev/irlpt0
crw-r--r--    1 root     161,  17 Nov  5 08:36 /dev/irlpt1
