C:ompile Instructions
--------------------
1. Clean the environment.
   Perform 'make clean'. This will erase all files and directories created during previous compilation.
2. Install.
   Perform 'make CROSS_COMPILE='compiler prefix''
   For 24.x Program
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

Testsuite execution
-------------------
1. Go to 'scripts' subdirectory inside the testsuite directory.
2. Execute the main script 'test_runner.sh -p 'scenario_id'.
   * The scenarios IDs can be found under script/scenarios/
3. Do an input for all configurations requiered by LMBENCH CONFIGURATION script
4. For this specific case LMBENCH does not report pass / fail status

Requirements
------------
The file system on which the testsuite is going to be executed needs to have the following utilities:
* sh
* bc
* bash
* diff
* cmp

Notes
-----
Once that you have already done with the configurations of LMBENCH, to get all results you have to copy the file saved under /lmbench/utils/lmbench-3.0-a9/results/3430SDP-3430.0 the .0 increases depending of the times that you run the tool. Once that you find this file, copy to the place where you compiled LMBENCH and execute:

#/location.of.lmbench-3.0/scripts/getsummary 3430SDP-3430.0

This give you the results in a better format. To perform this action you must have to PERL installed in your system.
