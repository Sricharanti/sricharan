C:ompile Instructions
--------------------
1. Clean the environment.
   Perform 'make clean'. This will erase all files and directories created during previous compilation.
2. Install.
   Perform 'make CROSS_COMPILE='compiler prefix''
   For 24.x Program
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

Testsuite execution
-------------------
1. Go to 'scripts' subdirectory inside the testsuite directory.
2. You have two options to run 'default' and 'custom'
	*To run just type './default.sh' or './custom.sh'
	*Default is used to run LMBENCH with pre-defined values commonly used.
	*Custom, allows user to configure by hand all the values required to run LMBENCH.
3. Once that you finished to run 'default' or 'custom' scripts, both scripts runt as last instruction the script
called 'results' who is the one who starts doing all job and calculations. ( the bench itself). It takes several
minutes, be patient.

Requirements
------------
The file system on which the testsuite is going to be executed needs to have the following utilities:
* sh
* bc
* bash

Notes
-----
Once that you have already done with the configurations of LMBENCH, to get all results you have to copy the file saved under /lmbench/utils/lmbench-3.0-a9/results/3430SDP-3430.0 the .0 increases depending of the times that you run the tool. Once that you find this file, copy to the place where you compiled LMBENCH and execute:

#/location.of.lmbench-3.0/scripts/getsummary 3430SDP-3430.0

This give you the results in a better format. To perform this action you must have to PERL installed in your system.
