Module Parameters
-----------------

* force: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs to boldly assume to be present
* force_addr: int
  Program the Super I/O register for the sensors ISA base address
* force_w83627hf: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs which are unquestionably assumed to contain
  a `w83781d' chip
* force_w83627thf:
  Ditto
* force_w83697hf:
  Ditto
* force_w83637hf:
  Ditto
* ignore: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs not to scan
* ignore_range: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples not to scan
* probe: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs to scan additionally
* probe_range: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples to scan additionally
* init=[0,1] (default 1)
  Use 'init=0' to bypass initializing the chip.
  Try this if your computer crashes when you load the module.


Description
-----------

This driver implements support for ISA accesses *only* for
the Winbond W83627HF, W83627THF, W83697HF and W83637HF Super I/O chips.
We will refer to them collectively as Winbond chips.

This driver supports ISA accesses, which should be more reliable
than i2c accesses. Also, for Tyan boards which contain both a
Super I/O chip and a second i2c-only Winbond chip (often a W83782D),
using this driver will avoid i2c address conflicts and complex
initialization that were required in the w83781d driver
(lm_sensors releases 2.7.0 and earlier).

If you really want i2c accesses for these Super I/O chips,
use the w83781d driver. However this is not the preferred method
now that this ISA driver has been developed.

Technically, the w83627thf does not support a VID reading.  However, it's
possible or even likely that your mainboard maker has routed these signals
to a specific set of general purpose IO pins (the Asus P4C800-E is one such
board).  The w83627thf driver now interprets these as VID.  If the VID on
your board doesn't work, first see doc/vid in the lm_sensors package.  If
that still doesn't help, email us at sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com.

For further information on this driver, /proc values, etc.
see the w83781d driver documentation.
