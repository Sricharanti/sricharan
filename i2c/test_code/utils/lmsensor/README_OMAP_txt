Compilation instructions:
-------------------------
Compile the package as:
make user CC=arm-linux-gcc

Application Installation Instructions:
---------------------------------------
copy the lib/libsensor* to rootfs lib directory
the applications that we are interested in are located in 
prog/detect [i2cdetect - used to probe all address of a given i2c bus] 
prog/dump [i2cdump - used to dump all registers of a given slave address on a certain i2c bus]

New Flags Introduced:
---------------------
With -h, uses High speed mode (NOT RECOMMENDED)
With -t, uses Ten Bit addressing mode (NOT RECOMMENDED)
With -i, uses i2c dev's read and write calls to probe the chips

Works for detect and dump test applications on OMAP platform

NOTE in i2cdetect: Combination of -q and -i will cause check for SMBUS_QUICK to be ignored 
and will attempt to write a single byte of 0 to the chip address. this is risky and should
*only be used* iff we know that this will not currupt any of the chips

i2cdump does not support "-q -i" support to prevent corruption of chip by mistake.
