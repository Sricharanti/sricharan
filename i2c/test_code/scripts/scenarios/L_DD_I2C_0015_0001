##Scenario: L_DD_I2C_0015_0001
## Author: Andrii Danylov
## Date: 15 Aug 2012
## Testing: I2C: Verify that i2c controller interrupts are only generated when the i2c module is in use or activated
## 1) From all i2c controllers verify one in which the clients connected can be disabled
## 2) Once all the i2c clients for that specific i2c bus are disabled verify the number of irq do not increment for a period of time
## 3) Enable any of the clients connected to the i2c bus and verify interrupts are incrementing
