C:ompile Instructions
--------------------

* * * VERY IMPORTANT FOR CLEAR CASE COMPULATION * * *
YOU NEED TO CHECKOUT THE FOLLOWING FILE TO COMPILE PROPERLY, IF YOU COMPILE LOCALLY IS NOT NECESARY

/vobs/wtbu/OMAPSW_L/linux/test/device_driver_test/mmc/test_code/utils/fs/e2fsprogs-1.36/configure/vobs/wtbu/OMAPSW_L/linux/test/device_driver_test/mmc/test_code/utils/fs/e2fsprogs-1.36/configure

1. Clean the environment.
   Perform 'make clean'. This will erase all files and directories created during previous compilation.
2. Install.
   Perform 'make CROSS_COMPILE='compiler prefix' HOST='host'
   For 8.x Program
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm_v6_vfp_le-
      * HOST=arm-linux

   For 12.x Program  ( READ AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR CLEAR CASE COMPILATION )
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
      * HOST=arm-none-linux-gnueabi

   For 18.x Program
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm-nonel-linux-gnueabi-
      * HOST=arm-none-linux-gnueabi


Testsuite execution
-------------------
1. Go to 'scripts' subdirectory inside the testsuite directory.
2. Execute the main script 'test_runner.sh -p 'scenario_id'.
   * The scenarios IDs can be found under script/scenarios/
3. Results will be reported showing Scenario-TestCase IDs and the result of each test.
   * 0 - Successful
   * Any other value different of 0 - Failure


Requirements
------------
The file system on which the testsuite is going to be executed needs to have the following utilities:
* sh
* bc
* fdisk
* bash
* diff
* cmp
The file systems also must have be able to mount and unmount partitions automatically, if not L_DD_MMC_0003 scenario will have some fails.
To work with MMC cards in both slots, there must be the following directory structure:
/mnt
   |_ mmc1
   |_ mmc2
An important requirement for all the test scenarios is that MMC cards must not have partitions.
Kernel should be compiled with "Native Language Support NLS ISO 8859-1". For 8.x and 18.x programs, this NLS is enabled by default; for 12.x kernel it is not. It can be enabled in "menuconfig -> File systems -> Native Language Support -> NLS ISO 8859-1  (Latin 1; Western European Languages)"


Notes
-----
A issue has been found sometimes when trying to copy files until get large MMC cards full. This issue is only present in
partitions formatted using mke2fs compiled with arm_v6_vfp_le compiler. A workaround for this issue is to use
the mke2fs utility from MV toolchain, since this issue is for 8.x program.
For L_DD_MMC_0009A test case, your file system must have a small file system to be copied to SD partition. The small file system should generate automatically a boot_log file at root directory (/boot_log). It must contents: 'Boot: OK' message.

	# cat /boot_log
	Boot: OK

Before run L_DD_MMC_0009A, BOOT_DIRECTORY envionment variable must be exported with the small file system path, for example:

	export BOOT_DIRECTORY=/testsuites/small_filesystem
