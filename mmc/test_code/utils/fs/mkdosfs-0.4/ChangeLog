	Modifications on Makefile to fit in a automated testsuite.

26th February 1997		Gordon Chaffee (chaffee@bmrc.berkeley.edu)

	Added support for creating FAT32 partitions.
	In theory, it should work on big endian machines now.

28th January 1995		H. Peter Anvin (hpa@yggdrasil.com)

	Better algorithm to select cluster sizes on large filesystems.
	Added bogus boot sector code that on attempts to boot prints a
	message (which can be chosen at mkdosfs time) and lets the user
	press any key and try again.  Corrected support for 1.2 Mb
	floppies.  mkdosfs now generates the extended bootsector
	(superblock) format of DOS 3.3+, with support for volume ID's and
	volume labels (volume labels are also written to the root
	directory, as they should).

1st September 1993		Dave Hudson (dave@humbug.demon.co.uk)
