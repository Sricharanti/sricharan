
########### IMPORTANT : IF YOU ARE USING TSLIB CODE FROM CLEARCASE FOR COMPILATION , PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS #################### 

Compilation steps(All these steps are w.r.t tslib directory)

1. Take a tslib source tar ball out of clearcase into different location.
2. Untar the tslib tar ball.
3. Rename tslib.sh to tslib.pc.in in tslib directory.
4. Run the command #> sh autogen.sh
5. Edit ./configure and remove the line no. 20623   "#define malloc rpl_malloc"
6. Run the command
#>./configure --host=arm-linux --prefix=<FS DIR> --bindir=<FS DIR>/bin --sbindir=<FS DIR>/sbin --libexecdir=<FS DIR>/libexec --datadir=<FS DIR>/share --sysconfdir=<FS DIR>/etc --sharedstatedir=<FS DIR>/com --localstatedir=<FS DIR>/var --libdir=<FS DIR>/lib --includedir=<FS DIR>/include --infodir=<FS DIR>/info --mandir=<FS DIR>/man

Where <FS DIR> should be replaced with the target file sytem(the location where ts test cases are executed).

7. Run make
8. Run make install

9. Setting up environment variables

We need to set up 2 variables: TSLIB_DEVICE and TSLIB_CONFFILE. The TSLIB_DEVICE is the device that the tslib will read datas from touchscreen, and the TSLIB_CONFFILE is the absolute PATH fot the ts.conf:

TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event1
(This is the correct input/eventX for OMAP 1510 and 1710. For others platform, you have to test it before set this variable)
TSLIB_CONFFILE=/etc/ts.conf
export TSLIB_TSDEVICE TSLIB_CONFFILE

We can put it on the /etc/profile and the environment variables will always be read at the boot time.

-----
3.4 CALIBRATING THE TOUCHSCREEN

The data sent by the touchscreen device is not proportional to the lcd. So, we need to calibrate it. All we need to do is execute the ts_calibrate and follow its instructions on the OMAP's lcd. After that, the /etc/pointercal will be create with calibrate data.

-----

All the executables and libraries are placed in the corresponding locations in target filesystem directories.
