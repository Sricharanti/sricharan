schedutils - Linux scheduler utility package
============================================

schedutils is maintained by Robert Love <rlove@rlove.org>


Introduction
------------

These are the Linux scheduler utilities - schedutils for short.  These programs
take advantage of the scheduler family of syscalls that Linux implements across
various kernels.  These system calls implement interfaces for scheduler-related
parameters such as CPU affinity and real-time attributes.  The standard UNIX
utilities do not provide support for these interfaces -- thus this package.

The programs that are included in this package are chrt and taskset.  Together
with nice and renice (not included), they allow full control of process
scheduling parameters.  Suggestions for related utilities are welcome, although
it is believed (barring new interfaces) that all scheduling interfaces are
covered.


Included Utilities:
-------------------

taskset
set or retrieve task CPU affinity for a given pid or execute a new task under
a given affinity mask.

ionice:
set or retrieve the I/O priority for a given pid or execute a new task with
a given I/O priority.  NOTE: I/O priority is a new feature, available since
2.6.12.

chrt:
set or retrieve real-time scheduling parameters for a given pid or execute a
new task under given scheduling parameters.'

irqset and lsrt were once included but are no longer.
