Compile Instructions
--------------------
1. Clean the environment.
   Perform 'make clean'. This will erase all files and directories created during previous compilation.
2. Install.
   Perform 'make KDIR='kernel directory' CROSS_COMPILE='compiler prefix''
   For 23.x Program
      * KDIR=/vobs/wtbu/OMAPSW_L/linux/kernel_org/2.6_kernel
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm-nonel-linux-gnueabi-


Testsuite execution
-------------------
1. Go to 'scripts' subdirectory inside the testsuite directory.
2. Execute the main script:
	test_runner.sh -p 'scenario_id'
   * The scenarios IDs can be found under script/scenarios/
3. Results will be reported showing Scenario-TestCase IDs and the result of each test.
   * 0 - Successful
   * Any other value different of 0 - Failure


Requirements
------------
The file system on which the testsuite is going to be executed needs to have the following utilities:
* sh
* bc
* bash
* diff
* cmp

Creating the id_rsa for set up passphrase authentication

   On the OMAP:

1. Make sure you have SSH installed on your filesystem.
2. Make sure you have a directory named /root/.ssh on your filesystem.
3. Run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa. By default, this will create files in
   /root/.ssh named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.
   The file id_rsa contains your private key.
   The file id_rsa.pub is the corresponding public key.
   You will be prompted to enter a "passphrase" that is a text string,
   that you will use for passphrase authentication.

    On the remote machine that you want to access:

1. Make a directory $HOME/.ssh on the remote machine.
2. Copy the contents of the file on your filesystem named /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   into a file on the remote machine named $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys.
   Make sure that you have not introduced any spurious line breaks into the file
   when you copy it.
   This single file can hold multiple public keys on separate lines.
3. Log out of the remote machine. Now when you connect to the remote machine
   from the OMAP, SSH will prompt you for the passphrase.
