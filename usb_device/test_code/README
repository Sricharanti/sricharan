Compile Instructions
--------------------
1. Clean the environment.
   Perform 'make clean'. This will erase all files and directories created during previous compilation.
2. Install.
   Perform 'make KDIR='kernel directory' CROSS_COMPILE='compiler prefix''
   For 23.x Program
      * KDIR=/vobs/wtbu/OMAPSW_L/linux/kernel_org/2.6_kernel
      * CROSS_COMPILE=arm-nonel-linux-gnueabi-


Testsuite execution
-------------------
1. Go to 'scripts' subdirectory inside the testsuite directory.
2. Execute the main script:
	test_runner.sh -p 'scenario_id'
   * The scenarios IDs can be found under script/scenarios/
3. Results will be reported showing Scenario-TestCase IDs and the result of each test.
   * 0 - Successful
   * Any other value different of 0 - Failure


Requirements
------------
The file system on which the testsuite is going to be executed needs to have the following utilities:
* sh
* bc
* bash
* diff
* cmp

Creating a 4 Mb file:
---------------------

1) In the filesystem for the OMAP Device, create a file to use as the mass
   storage, the following creates a 4MB file:

	$dd if=/dev/zero of=vfat_4MBeta bs=1M count=4
	4+0 records in
	4+0 records out
	4194304 bytes (4.2 MB) copied, 0.0207035 s, 203 MB/s

2) Create a filesystem on the backing_file_ext2.

	$mkfs.vfat vfat_4MBeta
	mkfs.vfat 2.11 (12 Mar 2005)



1) Creat a 4 Mb back file:
	$dd if=/dev/zero of=vfat_4M bs=1M count=4
	4+0 records in
	4+0 records out
	4194304 bytes (4.2 MB) copied, 0.0293511 s, 143 MB/s

2) Give a fat32 partition to the back file:
	$fdisk vfat_4M
	Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
	Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0xa4e0c663.
	Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
	After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

	You must set cylinders.
	You can do this from the extra functions menu.
	Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

	Command (m for help): x

	Expert command (m for help): s
	Number of sectors (1-63, default 63): 8
	Warning: setting sector offset for DOS compatiblity

	Expert command (m for help): h
	Number of heads (1-256, default 255): 1

	Expert command (m for help): c
	Number of cylinders (1-1048576): 1024

	Expert command (m for help): r

	Command (m for help): n
	Command action
	   e   extended
	   p   primary partition (1-4)
	p
	Partition number (1-4): 1
	First cylinder (2-1024, default 2): 2
	Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (2-1024, default 1024):
	Using default value 1024

	Command (m for help): t
	Selected partition 1
	Hex code (type L to list codes): b
	Changed system type of partition 1 to b (W95 FAT32)

	Command (m for help): p

	Disk vfat_4M: 0 MB, 0 bytes
	1 heads, 8 sectors/track, 1024 cylinders
	Units = cylinders of 8 * 512 = 4096 bytes
	Disk identifier: 0xa4e0c663

	  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
	vfat_4M1               2        1024        4092    b  W95 FAT32

	Command (m for help): w
	The partition table has been altered!

	Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.

	WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 25: Inappropriate ioctl for device.
	The kernel still uses the old table.
	The new table will be used at the next reboot.

	WARNING: If you have created or modified any DOS 6.x
	partitions, please see the fdisk manual page for additional
	information.
	Syncing disks.

Creating the id_rsa for set up passphrase authentication:
---------------------------------------------------------

   On the OMAP:

1. Make sure you have SSH installed on your filesystem.
2. Make sure you have a directory named /root/.ssh on your filesystem.
3. Run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa. By default, this will create files in
   /root/.ssh named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.
   The file id_rsa contains your private key.
   The file id_rsa.pub is the corresponding public key.
   You will be prompted to enter a "passphrase" that is a text string,
   that you will use for passphrase authentication.

    On the remote machine that you want to access:

1. Make a directory $HOME/.ssh on the remote machine.
2. Copy the contents of the file on your filesystem named /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   into a file on the remote machine named $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys.
   Make sure that you have not introduced any spurious line breaks into the file
   when you copy it.
   This single file can hold multiple public keys on separate lines.
3. Log out of the remote machine. Now when you connect to the remote machine
   from the OMAP, SSH will prompt you for the passphrase.

Using testusb on the remote desktop:
------------------------------------

1. You will need to download test.sh and testusb.c from the following web page
   http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/
2. Put this files on /data/utilities/usb folder of your Linux PC.
3. To do testusb on the remote PC from the OMAP terminal, you will use the
   id_rsa utility. For this you have to modify the test.sh file changing the
   directory where testusb is located on the remote PC (/data/utilities/usb).
   You can apply the patch that is located in the utils folder called
   testusb-onRemotePC.patch for this.
