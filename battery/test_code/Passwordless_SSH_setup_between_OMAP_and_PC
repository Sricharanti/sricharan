Phidget set up with AC power supply and micro USB cable is required.
The Micro USB cable contains 5 wires inside. The red colored wire is
the 5V VCC power supply wire. This should be used to connect to the
Phidget ports.

1)Login as the root user in OMAP target because we need the root
permissions to write few sysfs entries. At the OMAP side we need
to first cd to ~/.ssh directory.

2)Generate the RSA private and public key pair using:
	 ssh-keygen -t rsa
The above step will generate a pair of keys----------> id_rsa.pub
and id_rsa.

id_rsa.pub----------> Public key
id_rsa--------------> Private kay.

3)We need to copy the public key of OMAP (id_rsa.pub) to a file in PC ~/.ssh
folder called authorized_keys. We can use:
	cat id_rsa.pub > authorised_keys.

Now the public key is shared between OMAP and PC.

4)We need to create a "config" file which will have the following:

Host testing_host


HostName 		 172.24.137.178   /*  IP address of the server or PC */
IdentityFile		 ~/.ssh/id_rsa	        /* The private key */
User			 a0393675	  /* user name to login to the pc */

5)We can now use the SSH command to start executing commands on PC.
	ex: ssh testing_host ls
