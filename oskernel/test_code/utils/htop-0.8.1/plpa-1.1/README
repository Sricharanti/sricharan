This is the Portable Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) package
(pronounced "pli-pa").  It is intended for developers who wish to use
Linux processor affinity via the sched_setaffinity() and
sched_getaffinity() library calls, but don't want to wade through the
morass of 3 different APIs that have been offered through the life of
these calls in various Linux distributions and glibc versions.
