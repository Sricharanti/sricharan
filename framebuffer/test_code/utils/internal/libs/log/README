This contains the logging facilities for the test harness
and the tests that run in them. It also contains a wrapper
to run tests.

If you are writting a test, you want to look at the testlog
libraries. Log.py is for internal ATS use.

For more info on how to use these libraries, consult the
comments in the respective files. For the python library, you
can use pydoc to view the documentation. On RH 7.3 systems,
you must use 'pydoc2'.
